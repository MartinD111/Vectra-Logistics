# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-07-05)

**Core value:** Dispatchers must never be able to assign a load to a client who is over their credit limit or has a bad payment history — the risk semaphore is a hard, visible block, not a suggestion.
**Current focus:** Phase 2 — crm-dashboard-navigation-client-detail

## Current Position

Phase: 2
Plan: Not started
Status: Phase 01 complete — verified, ready to plan Phase 2

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Roadmap: Phase 1 must resolve `kpi_results.user_id NOT NULL` schema issue before Phase 6 (risk evaluator) can be built — treated as explicit early decision, not discovered mid-implementation
- Roadmap: Dedicated `crm` API domain (Phase 1) precedes all frontend/feature work — CRM logic currently fragmented in `billing`
- Roadmap: `email_messages` table lands in Phase 1 alongside other schema so Phase 5 (email sync) has no missing-table blocker

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- [Phase 1] `kpi_results.user_id` is NOT NULL today — needs schema resolution (nullable + `client_id` column, or equivalent) before Phase 6's client-subject risk evaluator can write results
- [Phase 1] No `email_messages` table exists yet — must be created before Phase 5 email sync work starts
- [Phase 1] `integration_credentials` table has no formal migration (schema drift risk) — not required for this project but worth fixing incidentally if touching Outlook integration code in Phase 5
